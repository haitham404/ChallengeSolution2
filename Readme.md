 ##  Exception Testing Guide

In the test class `QuantumBookstoreFullTest.java`, you'll find **commented-out code blocks** designed to test specific exception scenarios.  
Each block is labeled to indicate what kind of exception it triggers.

### ðŸ“Œ Exception Scenarios to Test

| Scenario | Expected Exception |
|----------|--------------------|
| Try to buy a **PaperBook that is out of stock** | `OutOfstockException` |
| Try to buy a **book that does not exist** | `NotFoundException` |
| Try to buy a **DemoBook** (not for sale) | `NotAbleToBuyException` |
| Try to buy a **PaperBook without an address** | `RequierdAdreesException` |

### âœ… How to Use

1. **Open** the test file: `QuantumBookstoreFullTest.java`
2. **Uncomment** the relevant test block for the exception you want to check.
3. **Run** the test.
4. **Observe** the output:
   - You should see the correct **exception message** printed to the console.
   - Confirm that the application correctly handles the error (e.g., no book is added to cart, balance is unchanged, etc.).

> This setup ensures your application gracefully handles invalid operations and provides clear, custom error messages.
